Hence why we need multiple human reference summaries to compute ROUGE and BLEU. However, as you are aware, these metrics have their limitations.*\n",

These metrics are dubious because they simply look at how much they overlap with reference texts from humans (https://rxnlp.com/how-rouge-works-for-evaluation-of-summarization-tasks/#.Xt1ewy-ZOi4).*"

It also penalizes words that appear in the candidate more times than it appears in any of the references.\n",
