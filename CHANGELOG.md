# This is how the project is being developed

## 05 Aug 2021
1. The app was scaffolded.
2. Implementing baseline with ready-to-use third-party solutions.
    - Refer to notebook 1 in `notebooks/` directory.

## 06 Aug 2021
1. Research on common metrics and datasets.
    - Refer to notebook 0 in `notebooks/` directory.
2. Started to implement baseline solution.

## 07 Aug 2021
1. Implemented a baseline solution in notebook 2.
    - Very basic and need more comments (will do later).
    - Really have learned a lot in my drafts.

### 08 Aug 2021
1. Started implementing an extended solution with heuristics.
    - Turned out that most of ready-to-use tools are outdated and incompatible.
    - The third-party algorithm also does not perform well enough.
    - Nothing works for now, still a lot left to do.
2. Drafted hybrid approach on abstractive summarization model.

### 09 Aug 2021
1. Monday. I did some web-demo stuff bc I seemingly out of my schedule.
    - Note: as a former web dev I would never use current approach to writing a webapp, but for now the least possible action principle is on.
2. Some updates on metrics (third-party sources).

### 12 Aug 2021
1. Actual research and loading of datasets.

### 13 Aug 2021
1. Writing loader and parser for downloaded datasets.

### 14 Aug 2012
1. Loading more datasets for compression.
2. Separating WIP parts from extended solution into separate notebooks to make exeriments on.
3. First drafts on extended solution summarization part.
